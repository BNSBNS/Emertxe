/*
 * Q-19
 *      Take n and k ( 1 <= k <= 10) as i/p. 
 *  Generate consecutive NRPS of len n using k distinct char
 * ( 0 <= k <=9 )
 *
 *  Explaination :
 *  1. Suppose k = 3 ( say taking 3 distinct characters )
 *      Let 3 distinct characters be a , b , c
 *  2. Suppose  'n' is the string length to be formed using
 *      'k' distinct words.
 *      Let n be 6
 *	3. The string should be formed in such a way that there should 
 *      not be any consecutive repetitions of the strings.
 *
 *  Example 1:
 *      If k = 3  & n = 6
 *      Valid NRPS string = abcacb
 *      Invalid NRPS string = abcabc ( since “ abc ” is occurring 
 *          consecutively)
 *  Example 2:
 *      If k = 3 & n = 5
 *      valid NRPS string = abcab
 *
 *  Sample run :
 *
 *      Input    : Enter the value of k , n and “ 
 *      k disctint characters” 3  6 a b c
 *	Output :  NRPS string = abcacb ( or any combination of 3
 *      distinct characters, where the string length is n = 6)
 *
