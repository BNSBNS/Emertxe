Hw: pencil and paper hw from Rama...., Oracle code for SQL and PL/SQL,
   and Java code for JDBC     Hw counts 25%, no more, no less.

Tests: 2 midterms and a non-comprehensive final (25%, 25%, 25%)
  Hw should be done individually.   We reserve the right to ask you
questions at any time to determine if you at least understood and 
mastered the hw you turned in.  There is, unfortunately, no way to
make sure you did it.  Provable copying or other plagiarism will result
in severe downgrading, including a possible F for ther class.

  If I say so, I will leave the exam room precisely  two minutes after I
say the exam has ended.  Any exam not in my possession when I leave the 
room will not be accepted, and you will get a zero for that exam.  I 
will do this if the exam writing does not end when I ask it to.  It is
WRONG to want kinder treatment for yourself than others.  Refusing to
stop when asked is a perfect example.

You may view exams in my office, but may not keep them for reasons of 
fairness vis-a-vis aggressive and non-aggressive students.  Please 
announce in advance by email if you want to view an exam at an office
hour.
